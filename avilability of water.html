<p> Water is contantly moving on the earth between ocean,river,ect.
Oceans covers about 2/3rds of the earthâ€™s surface and supports a
rich variety of plant and animal life. But, it is saline and
not useful for human consumption. Freshwater accounts for only
2.7% and 70% of these occurs as ice-sheets and glaciers in
Antarctica, Greenland and mountain region and they are inaccessible
because of their location. Thus, only 1% of freshwater is useful
for human consumption.</p>
